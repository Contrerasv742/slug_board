-- QUICK SETUP: Supabase Storage for Profile Pictures
-- Run this SQL script in your Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor

-- Step 1: Create the avatars storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars', 
  'avatars', 
  true, 
  5242880,  -- 5MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Step 2: Set up storage policies for the avatars bucket
-- Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Policy 2: Allow public read access to avatars
CREATE POLICY "Public can view avatars" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Policy 3: Allow users to update their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Policy 4: Allow users to delete their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Step 3: Verify the setup
SELECT 'Storage bucket created:' as status;
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types 
FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'avatars';

SELECT 'Storage policies created:' as status;
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Success message
SELECT 'âœ… Profile picture storage setup complete!' as result;
